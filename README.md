# HW08

**Please see the assignment instructions in Canvas as well as READMEs in the individual provided code packages (submodules).** 

*You must manually initially add the submodule for your ChatApp API design groups common repository.   This submodule will use a "submodule path" (mapping to a folder in the project) of <code>src/common</code>.  When the API is finalized, this submodule will be replaced with that for the class's final API.* 

Please see the Canvas pages, "Using the Discovery Server Package", "Using the PubSubSync Library" and the "ChatApp and Final Project Resources", for documentation and usage directions.  See the individual submodule READMEs and Javadocs for additional information.   Use the "Client+Cerver" discovery server configuration mode for the application.

### IMPORTANT: Put all assignment code (except common API) under a package name with the team's NetIDs, e.g. netid1_netid2.

This will prevent name clashes when transmitting classes.   Also, don't forget to change the module name in the <code>module-info.java</code> file.
